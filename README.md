#hyde

A fun little python project for hiding files in images.

## Definitely planned features
* hiding files in the lsbs of images
* recognizing files that have images hidden in this way and unhiding them

## Possibly planned features
* compressing files before storing them
* support for more than just pngs
* web interface (maybe through django)
* storing multiple files
* storing across multiple images
